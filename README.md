# BionicTexterizer

A cohort of mine came across something called "bionic reading" and shared it with me and other cohorts.
It supposedly would help with reading digital text by allowing one's eyes to fixate on artificial points using bold leading letters in each word of the text.
I was curious and came across this article that explains it well enough in my research of such a tool: https://www.newsweek.com/what-bionic-reading-why-feels-like-unlocking-your-brain-1708614

I liked it and came up with my own quick script that would make the first two letters of each word in a text bold and then save the output to a new file.
It is in a pretty basic state and should be easy to understand and manipulate for one's own needs and use cases.
My version of this program only used the Python standard library and the python-docx library (https://python-docx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
